    <h1>Career growth and development</h1>
    <p>Working in tech also offers several opportunities for career growth and skill development.</p>

    <p>You can refine your skills and improve your workflow with every <br>
       task by applying your knowledge to practical experiences. The <br>
       skills you learn and apply are transferrable, and they can increase <br>
       your marketability and advance your career by appealing to <br>
       potential employers. <br></p>
      
      <p> You can also consider applying them independently to create <br>
       your own startup business.</p>

       <P>Many brands operate a relaxed dress policy (we do at Ciphr for <br>
          office-based staff). You don’t need to come to work every day in <br>
          a 3 piece suit, just spruce yourself up a bit with a casual shirt and <br> 
          trousers. <br>
          The same goes for footwear, scruffy two year old trainers can be <br>
          replaced with a pair of casual shoes.</P>

    <h1>Get	social	on	and	offline</h1>
    <p>Getting to know your colleagues socially is a great way to learn <br> 
       how people tick, but also to strike up new friendships. <br>
       It’s often the case that people will work better together if they <br>
       socialise as well. Connecting with colleagues on social media <br>
       helps you and them to bond and become more cohesive as a <br> 
       team.</p>


    <h1>Be	proactive	and	‘give	it	a	go’</h1>
    
  
    <p>Pushing	yourself	and	getting	out	of	your	comfort	zone’s	a	good	way	to	learn <br>	
       new	skills	and	become	more	confident.	Speaking	at	the	company	meeting, <br>	
       attending	customer	events or	meeting	clients	in	person,	whatever	it	is,	offer <br>	
       your	services	and	don’t	wait	to	be	asked,	people	will	notice	your	pro-active	<br>
       nature. <br>
       Offering	yourself	up	for	new	challenges	will	also	add	variety	into	your	daily <br>	
       schedule,	stimulating	your	creativity	and	giving	you	a	break	from	the	regular	<br>
       routine.</p>

    <p>When you connect with others that share similar interests in the <br>
       tech industry, you're building your professional network. <br>
       Attending local conferences, contributing to online tech forums <br>
       and talking to local professionals are all effective methods to <br>
       expand your tech industry connections. </p>
